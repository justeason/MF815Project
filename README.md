# MF815Midterm Project

Background:
Loan Default Prediction
You are provided a dataset for vehicle loan default prediction where you need to predict the customer who will default for paying the EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments).
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default. A financial institution has hired you to accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI on the due date. Following Information regarding the loan and loanee are provided in the datasets:
Loanee Information (Demographic data like age, Identity proof etc.) Loan Information (Disbursal details, loan to value ratio etc.)
Bureau data & history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc.)
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimising the default rates.
Tasks:
1. Split the training data into training and validation sets.
2. Using the training and validation data sets to select classification models to predict
loan default. You are expected to use at least three methods that you learned in our
class.
3. Select the best model from all your models. Predict the loan default status in the test
set using the best model.
4. Report the performance (accuracy, F1-score for each class, AUC) for each of your
model using different methods.
Report:
1. Submit a file of your Python notebook or R script which contains all codes and model results. Please explain what model you choose to use and what result each model produces. Please also add comments to your codes.
2. Submit a csv containing the test data and your predicted default status as the last column.
3. Submit these two files separately. Do not Zip them together.
